# JAVA-Library-Management
In this project, i'm trying  to developing an application for library management, particularly book borrowing.

This application allows you to manage books, students and loans.

• Book management consists of creating (via the application) new books (and adding them to the database), modifying, deleting and listing books. When creating a new book, its stock is initialized to 0 by default.

• Student management consists of creating new students, modifying, deleting and listing students.

• Borrowing management involves borrowing one, two or three books from a student. This management must also allow the books to be returned to the library.
